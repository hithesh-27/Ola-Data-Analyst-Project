# Ola-Data-Analyst-Project

🔹 Project Overview

This project analyzes Ola ride data to extract insights on customer travel patterns, fare distribution, ride demand, and operational efficiency. The workflow involved data cleaning in Google Sheets, preparing structured data in Excel, and building interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key metrics for business decisions.

🔹 Objectives

Clean and prepare raw ride data for analysis.

Identify peak booking hours and high-demand locations.

Analyze ride category popularity and fare distribution.

Compare payment method usage across customers.

Build Power BI dashboards to communicate findings effectively.

🔹 Dataset

Ola rides dataset (sample/mock dataset).

Key fields included:

Ride ID

Customer ID

Pickup & Drop location

Date & Time

Ride Distance

Ride Category (Micro, Mini, Prime, Auto, etc.)

Fare Amount

Payment Method

Ratings

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used

Google Sheets → Data cleaning (removing duplicates, nulls).

MS Excel → Data formatting, CSV handling, pivot tables, initial analysis.

Power BI → Data visualization, dashboards, KPIs.

MySQL Workbench - Querying the dataset

🔹 Steps & Approach

1. Data Cleaning (Google Sheets)

Imported raw dataset into Google Sheets.

Removed duplicates and invalid entries.

Checked for missing values and corrected inconsistencies.

Exported the cleaned dataset to CSV format.


2. Data Preparation (Excel)

Imported the cleaned CSV file into Excel.

Standardized date and time columns.

Validated ride distance and fare values.

Created pivot tables for quick checks and summaries.

Saved the final dataset for Power BI import.

3. SQL Analysis (MySQL Workbench)

Used MySQL Workbench to query the Ola dataset and extract key insights. Wrote SQL queries to:

Identify peak booking hours and busiest locations.

Calculate average fares by ride category.

Analyze revenue contribution by payment method.

Segment rides into short, medium, and long distances.


4. Data Visualization (Power BI)

Imported the Excel dataset into Power BI.

Built dashboards with:

Ride demand trends (by day, hour, month).

Top pickup & drop-off locations.

Revenue contribution by ride category.

Fare distribution and average fare analysis.

Payment method usage.

Customer ratings overview.

KPIs: Total Rides, Total Revenue, Avg Fare.


4. Insights & Findings

Peak booking hours: 8–10 AM and 6–9 PM (commute times).

Most popular ride type: Ola Mini (affordable segment).

UPI and Wallets were the most used payment methods.

Short rides dominated in count, but longer rides generated higher revenue.

Identified high-demand zones with driver shortages → opportunity to optimize driver allocation.

🔹 Results

Built a Power BI dashboard showcasing ride trends, customer behavior, and revenue drivers.

Delivered actionable insights to improve customer experience and operational efficiency.

🔹 Future Scope

Add predictive analysis to forecast ride demand.

Expand dataset for multi-city comparisons.

Perform customer segmentation for targeted offers.
